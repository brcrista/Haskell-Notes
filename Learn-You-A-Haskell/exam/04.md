A **typeclass** is a set of types that all implement some set of functions.
Usually, these functions are related by formal laws that are not checked by the compiler.
An example of a typeclass is `Eq a`, which defines the `(==)` and `(/=)` functions.

A **type constructor** is a meta-type that cannot be instantiated on its own because it has type parameters.
An example of a type constructor is the `Maybe` in `Maybe a`.

Typeclasses and type constructors are similar in that:
1. Neither can be used on their own to construct values
1. Both may contain type parameters
1. Both may be used in a type annotation as the type of a value

Typeclasses and type constructors differ in their end use.
Type constructors have their type parameters bound to form concrete types, while existing types declare and define their typeclass memberships.
